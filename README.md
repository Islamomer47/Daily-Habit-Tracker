# Daily Habit Tracker

## Project Overview

The **Daily Habit Tracker** is designed to help users build and maintain positive habits over time. It enables users to track their daily activities, set goals, and visualize their progress. With features like habit categorization, progress tracking, and visualizations, this application motivates users to achieve their goals consistently.

## Features

### 1. Add New Habits

Users can create new habits they want to develop, such as exercising, reading, meditating, or drinking water. Each habit entry includes:

- **Habit Name**: The title of the habit.
- **Description**: A brief description of the habit.
- **Completion Status**: Track whether the habit is completed each day.

### 2. Track Habit Progress

Users can mark their habits as completed each day and view their progress over time. This helps in identifying patterns and staying consistent.

### 3. Habit Categories and Tags

Users can categorize their habits (e.g., health, productivity, mindfulness) to organize and filter them effectively. Tags can also be used for more specific categorization.

### 4. Visualize Progress

The application includes visualizations such as progress bars, which provide a visual representation of how close users are to achieving their goals.

### 5. Main Page

- **Habit List**: Displays a list of all habits with options to filter by category or tag. The status of each habit (completed or not) is shown.
- **Add Habit**: A button that opens a modal or navigates to a form page for adding a new habit.
- **Edit Habit**: An edit button next to each habit allows users to modify its details.
- **Delete Habit**: A delete button next to each habit enables users to remove it from the tracker.
- **Habit Filters**: Dropdowns or checkboxes to filter habits by category, frequency, or tag.
- **Search Field**: A search field to find specific habits quickly.
